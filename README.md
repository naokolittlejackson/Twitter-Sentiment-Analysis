# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a twitter sentiment analysis project I created. The purpose of this model is analyze user sentiment through tweets and comments. The model is vital because it provides significant insight to companies during product launches by understanding customer behavior to make data driven decisions. 

# What is natural language processing? 

When performing machine learning analysis on text natural language processing is a requirement. Natural language processing works by converting words into mathematical vectors that are used for different machine learning models for prediction. Once the mathematical vectors are converted into different vectors, they are given for the machine learning models for prediction respectively. Therefore, with the features that are present in the text along with some newly created features, the machine learning, and deep learning models would be using those techniques and ensures that they are getting the best outputs respectively.
